# N3v4
Nostabs Numpad Navigator, fourth version

This is a "hybrid wired" keyboard.  The matrix is a PCB, which is then hand-wired to any MCU with 23 or more GPIO ports.  The layout avoids stabilizers and has an unstaggered numrow that could also be set up as an F row.  Keycap kitting can be a challenge, but apart from flat profiles, several vendors include appropriate sized Cherry-profile keycaps in their 40% support kits, and sets that use the same profile for the bottom row and the caps/enter row can also be leveraged.
